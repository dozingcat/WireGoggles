# WireGoggles

As of March 2018 WireGoggles is not under active development. I may fix bugs but don't plan to add new features.
[Vector Camera](https://github.com/dozingcat/VectorCamera) is its successor.

WireGoggles is an Android app that displays a real-time wireframe outline of what your camera is
pointing at. You can choose from several rendering styles and create your own color schemes, and
save pictures and videos.

This started out several years ago as a way to learn Android development. Much of the code is
old and not well structured, and should not be taken as the best way to do things.
